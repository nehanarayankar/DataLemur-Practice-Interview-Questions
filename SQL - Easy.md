 # DataLemur SQL - Easy

 ### 1. **Histogram of Tweets**

 Assume you're given a table Twitter tweet data, 
write a query to obtain a histogram of tweets posted per user in 2022. 
Output the tweet count per user as the bucket and the number of Twitter users who fall into that bucket.

In other words, group the users by the number of tweets they posted in 2022 and count the number of users in each group.

```sql
select 
	tweet_count as tweet_bucket,
	count(*) as users_num
from
	(select 
		count(tweet_id) tweet_count,
		user_id
	from 
		tweets
	where 
		tweet_date between '2022-01-01' and '2022-12-31'
	group by 
		user_id)
table1
group by 
	tweet_count

```

### 2. **DataScience Skills**

Given a table of candidates and their skills, you're tasked with finding the candidates best suited for an open Data Science job. You want to find candidates who are proficient in Python, Tableau, and PostgreSQL.

Write a query to list the candidates who possess all of the required skills for the job. 
Sort the output by candidate ID in ascending order.

```sql
select 
	candidate_id
from 
	candidates
where 
	skill in ('Python', 'Tableau', 'PostgreSQL')
group by 
	candidate_id
having 
	count(distinct skill) >= 3
order by 
	candidate_id
```

**OR**

```sql
select 
	candidate_id
from 
	candidates
group by 
	candidate_id
having 
	sum(
		(case when skill = 'Python' then 1 else 0 end) +
		(case when skill = 'Tableau' then 1 else 0 end) +
		(case when skill = 'PostgreSQL' then 1 else 0 end) 
		) = 3
order by 
	candidate_id
```

### 3. **Pages With No Likes**

Assume you're given two tables containing data about Facebook Pages and their respective likes (as in "Like a Facebook Page").

Write a query to return the IDs of the Facebook pages that have zero likes. 
The output should be sorted in ascending order based on the page IDs.


```sql
select 
	p.page_id 
from 
	pages p
left join 
	page_likes pl on pl.page_id = p.page_id
where 
	pl.page_id is null
```


### 4. **Unfinished Parts**

Tesla is investigating production bottlenecks and they need your help to extract the relevant data. 
Write a query to determine which parts have begun the assembly process but are not yet finished.

Assumptions:
parts_assembly table contains all parts currently in production, each at varying stages of the assembly process.
An unfinished part is one that lacks a finish_date.
This question is straightforward, so let's approach it with simplicity in both thinking and solution.

```sql
select 
	part,
	assembly_step
from 
	parts_assembly
where 
	finish_date is null
```


### 5. **Laptop Vs Mobile Viewership**

Assume you're given the table on user viewership categorised by device type where the three types are laptop, tablet, and phone.

Output the total viewership for laptops as laptop_reviews and the total viewership for mobile devices as mobile_views.

```sql
with views as(
	select 
		count(*) num_views,
		device_type
	from 
		viewership
	group by 
		device_type
)

select 
	sum
		(case when device_type = 'laptop' then num_views else 0 end) as laptop_views,
	sum
		(case when device_type in ('phone','tablet') then num_views else 0 end) mobile_views
from
	views
```


### 6. **Average Post Hiatus**

Given a table of Facebook posts, for each user who posted at least twice in 2021, write a query to find the number of days between each userâ€™s first post of the year and last post of the year in the year 2021. Output the user and number of the days between each user's first and last post.

```sql
select 
	user_id,
	days_between
from
	(
	select 
		user_id,
		max(post_date::date) - min(post_date::date)  as days_between
	from 
		posts
	where 
		date_part('year',post_date) = 2021
	group by 
		user_id
	having 
		count(post_id)>1
)table1
```

Assumption:
No two users have sent the same number of messages in August 2022.


```sql
select 
	sender_id,
	count(message_id) num_msgs
from 
	messages
where 
	(sent_date::date) between '2022-08-01' and '2022-08-31'
group by 
	sender_id
order by 
	count(message_id) desc
limit 2 
```


## 8. **Well Paid Employees**

Companies often perform salary analyses to ensure fair compensation practices. 
One useful analysis is to check if there are any employees earning more than their direct managers.

As a HR Analyst, you're asked to identify all employees who earn more than their direct managers. The result should include the employee's ID and name.

```sql
select 
	e.employee_id,
	e.name
from 
	employee e
join 	
	employee m on m.employee_id = e.manager_id
where 
	e.salary > m.salary
```

select 
	account_id,
	sum (
		 case 
		 	when transaction_type = 'Deposit' then amount 
			when transaction_type = 'Withdrawal' then amount * (-1) 
		 	else 0

	count(
		case when product like 'QuickBooks%' then 1 end) as quickbooks_total
	
from
	filed_taxes
```

### 11. **App Click-Thru Rate**

Assume you have an events table on Facebook app analytics. Write a query to calculate the click-through rate (CTR) for the app in 2022 and round the results to 2 decimal places.

Definition and note:
Percentage of click-through rate (CTR) = 100.0 * Number of clicks / Number of impressions
To avoid integer division, multiply the CTR by 100.0, not 100.

```sql
with table1 as
	(
	select 
		app_id,
		sum(
			case when event_type = 'click' then 1 
			else 0
			end) 
		as num_clicks,
		sum(
			case when event_type = 'impression' then 1
			else 0
			end)
		as num_impressions
	from 
		events
	where 
		date_part('year',timestamp) = 2022
	group by 
		app_id
)

select 
	app_id,
	round(100.00 * num_clicks / nullif (num_impressions,0),2) as ctr_percentage
from 
	table1
```

Additionally, it should count the number of employees who did not run any queries during this period.

Display the number of unique queries as histogram categories, along with the count of employees who executed that number of unique queries.

```sql
with table1 as
	(
	select
		employee_id,
		count(distinct query_id) unique_query_count
	from
		queries
	where 	
		date(query_starttime) between '2023-07-01' and '2023-09-30'
	group by 
		employee_id
),
table2 as
	(
	select 
		unique_query_count,
		count(*) employee_count
	from 
		table1
	group by unique_query_count
),
table3 as
	(
	select 
		count(*) employee_count
	from
		employees
	where 
		employee_id not in (select employee_id from table1) 
)

select * from table2
union all 
select 0 as unique_query_count, employee_count from table3
order by unique_query_count
```

```sql
select 
	round(sum(item_count*order_occurrences)::numeric/sum(order_occurrences),1)
from 
	items_per_order
```

**OR**

```sql
select

from 
	items_per_order
```
